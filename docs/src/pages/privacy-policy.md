## Data collection, sharing, and storage

File Converter Tool is not intended to collect, share, and/or store data to any third-parties over the Internet. File conversion processing is intended to be run on your local device.

The libraries/programs used can be found within the File Converter Tool's source code at https://github.com/rzmk/fct.

These libraries/programs have not been independently verified by us to ensure that they do not access the Internet and/or collect, share, and/or store data.
